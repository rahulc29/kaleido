# Kaleido 
Kaleido is supposed to be a toy language that I'm implementing in accordance to the [LLVM tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/LangImpl01.html).
My aim is to learn the LLVM infrastructure and APIs effectively.

The original tutorial notes that it doesn't the "best engineering practices" to teach the more important concepts - such as how to implement a lexer. In contrast to this, I intend to maintain as much readability as possible.

I'm also not implementing things the tutorial way to get a feel for things myself.
